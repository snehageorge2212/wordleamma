# 🎉 Happy Wordle for Mom 🎂

A special Wordle-style game made just for my mom’s birthday!  
The answer is a sweet nickname — **GAMMY** 💖

## 💡 How It Works
- Guess a 5-letter word
- You get 6 tries
- After each guess:
  - 🟩 Green = correct letter & correct place
  - 🟨 Yellow = correct letter, wrong place
  - ⬜ Gray = not in the word
- If you guess **GAMMY** — you win with a surprise message!

## 🚀 How to Play
Just open the `index.html` file in any browser  
Or visit the live site:

## 💝 Why I Made This
Because no one deserves a surprise more than you, Mom!  
Happy Birthday and lots of love! 🎈
